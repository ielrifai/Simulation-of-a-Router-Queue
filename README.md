# Simulation-of-a-Router-Queue

The simulation program will make use of the queue ADT to model a queue in a router. This queue is assumed to be infinite in
length (i.e. no restriction on the size of the queue). Packets will arrive into the queue at rate λ. Time taken
to serve these packets (i.e. forward to the appropriate link) is fixed as dictated by the service rate µ.
